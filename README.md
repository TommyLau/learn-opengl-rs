This is a Rust port of https://github.com/JoeyDeVries/LearnOpenGL which is implemented in C++.

The OpenGL tutorials could be found at: https://learnopengl.com/

This repository's code structure has been kept as same as possible to the original C++ source code, and obey the Rust naming conventions at the same time.

Tutorials can be ran like the following (for example: `src/_1_getting_started/_3_6_shaders_exercise3.rs`):

```bash
cargo run 1.3.6
```
