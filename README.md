# learn-opengl-rs

This is a Rust port of https://github.com/JoeyDeVries/LearnOpenGL

The tutorials can be found at https://learnopengl.com/

The source code structure has been kept similar to the original C++ source code as possible as I can, but also make the code Rust style.

Tutorials can be ran like the following (for example: `src/_1_getting_started/_3_6_shaders_exercise3.rs`):

```bash
cargo run 1.3.6
```
